    Why do dental professionals recommend the CS 5460? Two words. Gentle. And efficient. The ultra-fine, CUREN® filaments are densely packed on the brush head to give exceptional cleaning power. And it looks beautiful.
    
    Plaque’s toughest enemy is the gentleness of CUREN®-bristles: CS toothbrushes really are incredibly gentle. The 5460 CUREN®-filaments of the CS 5460 ultra soft form an uncommonly dense and efficient cleaning surface. While they are gentle on gums and teeth, CUREN®-filaments are extremely hard on plaque. Anyone who tries a CS toothbrush will never want to do without this
    brushing experience again.
    
    CURAPROX toothbrushes not only prevent brushing damage, but also break up and remove plaque perfectly. CUREN ®-filaments are stiffer than nylon and remain just as stable in the mouth as when they are dry. These properties make it possible to produce toothbrushes with a large number of ultrafine bristles.
    
    Gentle action thanks to CUREN®-filaments
    Efficient cleaning surface thanks to a dense array of CUREN®-filaments
    There’s no escape: compact head, slightly angled
    Octagonal handle helps users to brush at the correct angle`,
